# Computational Quantum Mechanics
A project on Fourier grid Hamiltonian method and Quantum Monte Carlo method  
  
This is a project I've done when taking Quantum Mechanics.  
+ The FGH/ folder implements Fourier grid Hamiltonian method,  
  which can solve for the ground state, and excited states of single-particle 2D quantum system.  
+ The QMC/ folder implements Quantum Monte Carlo method,  
  which can solve for the ground state wave function of any dimensional multi-Boson system.
