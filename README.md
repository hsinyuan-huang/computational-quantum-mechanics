A project on Fourier grid Hamiltonian method and Quantum Monte Carlo method

This is a project I've done when taking Quantum Mechanics.<n>
1) The FGH/ folder implements Fourier grid Hamiltonian method,<n>
   which can solve for the ground state, and excited states of single-particle 2D quantum system.<n>
2) The QMC/ folder implements Quantum Monte Carlo method,<n>
   which can solve for the ground state wave function of any dimensional multi-Boson system.<n>
